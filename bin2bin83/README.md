bin2bin83
=========


Description
-----------

This tool is designed to *unsquish* your code.
It reverses the hex and ascii representation (and make twice bigger)
You need to use it if you want to do **ti83 regular noshell** asm progs.


How to use
----------

Simply compile it :
`gcc -o bin2bin83 bin2bin83.c`

Or simply :

`make` 


To use it :

`./bin2bin83 src.bin dest.bin`


Before using this tool you need to use spasm or z80asm.
After using this tool you need to use bin2var or bin8x.

Or a better idea : use bin8x improved (on my author's page) which include this tool.
